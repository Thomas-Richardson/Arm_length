# Arm_length
data and code for a paper on arm length and fighting success

The best way to run this is to access the script through the Binder notebook here: https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/thomas-richardson-arm_length-rmqxoss8/rstudio/?token=ValKra_4SdSjf7TGVX0pFA

This allows you to access my script in browser, no R or packages required.
